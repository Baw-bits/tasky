# tasky

This is a todo app that makes use of both flutter and golang for front and backend.
This app tries to simplify the use of mobile phones by making use of one hand operation where deleting, edit and viewing can be done by the direction you swipe.
This app takes in task name and details which is then passed to the backend for temporary storage and can be called to view individual tasks.
Deleting a task is possible by swipping left and swipping right to view or edit. All this striggers the backend which performs thee calling, deleting and update of a task.
